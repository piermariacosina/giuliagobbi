HorizonalWP 2012

General setup and use
—
Uploading the theme:
All you have to do is upload the theme files to your 
"wp-content" folder then activate the theme via the 
"Appearance > Themes" dialog in your Wordpress Admin.

Creating a post:
With the new HorizontalWP themes, you should have the ability
to create posts how you normally would with any other theme. 
All image resizing, text handling/moving, is done dynamically
with jQuery. You don't have to worry about a thing. 

*However, if you are going to use custom html, do so at your 
own risk. Some elements may break the themes. If this happens, 
simply remove these elements.*

Videos:
The theme does support video formats including object embedding,
iframe, and html5 video, however you must be sure that any video
includes a height and width property.

This will work:
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="video.format" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This will not work:
<iframe src="video.format" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Image color detection:
This theme's image color detection only works for images which
are hosted on your server. This is because of security restrictions
and browser support for CORS (cross-origin resource sharing).

Load Times:
Our themes are obviously horizontal, and in order to judge the
width needed for the pages jQuery must load all images prior to 
displaying them. If your load times are too long, consider 
uploading lower-resolution images or limiting the posts per page
via the "Settings>Reading" option within the Wordpress Admin.

Further Customization:
For further theme control see the "theme options" section within 
the Wordpress Admin or contact gregponchak@gmail.com for a custom
quote.
